#Just a Simple Binary Counter

A simple Binary counter implemented in NI Multisim.

The binary counter uses two Synchronous 4-bit binary counters (7416N). This particular IC includes an internal look ahead circuitry for faster counting and a carry over output for cascading multiple similar ICs for n-bit counters.

Note that a screen shot of the underlying circuitry is also included just in case this simple implementation needs to be implmented and tested on a platform other than the NI Multisim. Also a working video of the simulation can be found here:https://youtu.be/tmF-qnYPjWU
